I have a variety of hobbies and activites I engage with in my spare time

## Classic Doom mapping and modding
Doom (1993) is a highly moddable game that has stood the test of time. I am part of a wide and evergreen community of mappers and modders, and I have participated and contributed to many events. Some of my Doom map submissions are available online to download and play with a source port. I dabble with speedmapping - Mapping out entire levels in a short time period, typically 2-6 hours. I go by "Zero the Red" in the Doomworld forums and communities.

I have contributed speedmaps to the following community-made map compilations
* [Imperfect Hatred](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/imphate-v4) - MAP06 "Emerald Dynamo"
* [Clandestine Castle Crashing 2](https://www.doomworld.com/vb/thread/134337) - MAP05 "The Temple of the Blood Knight"
* [Quick and Dirty](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/puss30_qnd) - MAP05 "Spider Plasmonics"

I have contributed as a playtester for the following mapsets
* [Boss Battle Bonanza](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/a-c/bbb-v6)
* [12 Days of Doom-mas](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/themes/xmas/12days-v4)
* [Clandestine Castle Crashing](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/megawads/puss5-ccc)

* I was a member of the winning team in [Hot Potato](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/119076-hot-potato-team-mapping-event-boom-leage-wad-out-now/) - A speedmapping competition between two teams mapping in the older Boom and more modern UDMF format respectively. My team was the Boom-format mapping league
* I was part of the judging panel for [Mapping Off](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/134491-live-charity-stream-myolden-vs-bluepineapple72-mapping-off-live-on-television/), a speedmapping competition hosted as a charity event. All donations proceeded to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. The recording of the competition livestream is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcNCPuaTLU8)

## Drawing 
I enjoy drawing pencil-shaded sketches from time to time. My genres are biomechanical art and science-fiction art. Occasionally, I dabble with pixel art using Aseprite. My inspirations are H.R.Giger, Zdzisław Beksiński, Salvador Dali, and Mariusz Lewandowski.
