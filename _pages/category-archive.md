## UAV Swarm coordination simulator
Constructed safe and dynamically feasible trajectories of a swarm of 64+ UAVs in a random 3D obstacle forest, using convex hull optimization in ROS, C++ and MATLAB.

## Neural Network-based Object Localisation with Discriminators for Specialised Applications
Implemented a combination of a bounding box regressor and a classifier trained from Kaggle Datasets to beat the YOLO detection algorithm while attempting to classify aircraft models. Our model occupied almost 70% less storage space and was 2-3x faster.

## GAML Multi-Agent Simulator  
Created a multi-agent simulator in GAML that shows 7 classes of customers interacting with each other and with 10+ stores, while simulating instances of thievery and law enforcement.

## Autonomous TIAGo Robot Manipulation 
Programmed a TIAGo robot on ROS (Python) to perform mobile manipulation tasks such as pick-place and obstacle avoidance
using SLAM.

## Detection of Dark Matter within the solar system
Developed a theoretical colloid-thruster propelled satellite project proposal with a team of 6 students to directly detect Dark Matter WIMPs and axions within the solar system using a Skipper-CCD, a quantum accelerometer, and Axion Haloscopes.

## Path-Planning Simulator
Built a simple graphical simulator in Python that demonstrated the A*, RRT, and Dijkstra’s
algorithm. Currently working on implementing Probabilistic Road Maps, Potential Fields, and D* algorithms to expand
the simulator’s capabilities.

## Genetic Algorithm Simulator
Wrote a simulator for genetic algorithms using the Dear PyGui framework in
Python. The goal is to learn and experiment with the GA hyperparameters and provide a useful learning resource to
gain a visual understanding of the algorithm’s workings.

## Spacecraft Attitude Control Simulator
Developed a simulator to test and perform attitude control of satellites using
adaptive PID controllers in C++.
