title: "About Me"
---

I am a simulations, robotics, and programming enthusiast with a **Dual Masters in Robotics and Autonomous Systems** and a **Bachelors in Instrumentation and Control Engineering**. I have a strong background in Python and C++ programming, algorithm and robot simulations, control systems design, and computer vision. I am open to contributing my skills to companies and research organizations looking for an *adept problem solver*, *quick & adaptive learner*, and a *dynamic cross-functional team collaborator*.

My vision and long-term career goals are to leverage my strong interdisciplinary knowledge in autonomous systems, robot controls, and programming towards making impactful contributions to the fields of aerospace & defence, healthcare, R&D, Earth observation, agriculture, and physics. 

My hobbies include drawing, reading, maintaining by personal wiki, and developing video game maps and mods.
