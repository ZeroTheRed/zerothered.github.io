## Excillum - Masters Thesis Student 
**Duration**: Feb 2023 - Aug 2023

Developed a closed-loop automatic alignment system using numerical optimization-based controls
for X-ray spectrometers, achieving a *72% increase in photon counts* with less than *0.1° accuracy* compared to manual methods. Coordinated with 15+ X-ray research scientists, software engineers, and production teams to
integrate the system across R&D labs, eliminating the need for manual adjustments.
* *Python* was used for developing the Nelder-Mead Optimization algorithm and the GUI in Qt for monitoring and visualizing the radiation heatmaps and spectrometer orientation.
* *C++* was used for interfacing the X-123 CdTe spectrometers to PCs. This involved debugging *libusb* code and modifying the acquisition performance of the spectrometer.
* *MATLAB* was used for post-processing and adjustment of the X-ray emission spectra for comparison.

## TU Munich - Summer School Participant
**Duration**: Jul 2022 - Aug 2022

Designed and pitched a startup called IoTeria with a group of 6 colleagues under the guidance of
Siemens, which aimed to provide a proof-of-concept for a secure pay-per-use metering service for Edge-IoT-based industrial processes to perform predictive maintenance solutions.
Gained experience and training in system modeling (SysML, BPMN), IIoT, and Industry 4.0 technologies.

## THS Armada - Events Team Organizer
**Duration**: Oct 2021 - Nov 2021

Collaborated with the KTH Student Union’s career fair organizing team to attract 130+ leading
companies from all over Europe (notably Vattenfall, ABB, Capgemini, and Atlas Copco), and spearheaded the arrangement of seminars and events for 5000+ students.

## DRDO Research and Innovation Centre - Summer Research Intern
**Duration**: May 2019 - Jul 2019

Engineered and simulated a biomimetic MEMS Flow Sensor using COMSOL that achieved a 55.6%
higher performance to flow changes than regular flow sensors to be deployed on underwater
autonomous vehicles for the Indian Navy. Worked with a team of 3 people to test multiple flow sensor designs and documented the fabrication process.

## Delta Electronics - Inplant Robotics Intern
**Duration**: Dec 2018

Assisted in the construction and operation of a pick-and-place robot system to segregate faulty circuit
breakers in the assembly line, and a SCARA robot to perform electrical continuity tests of the components.
Performed basic hardware assembly, electrical wiring, PLC programming, and cable labeling for the DRV90L articulated
robot.

## CSIR Central Scientific Instruments Organization - Summer Research Intern
**Duration**: May 2018 - Jun 2018

Designed an image processing program for the Raspberry Pi 3 and the RPi Camera using OpenCV that
detected suitable coconuts to pluck while checking for visual imperfections using CNNs and Circular
Hough Transforms to select the right coconut automatically, with an accuracy of 81%.
