# Tushar Sairam's Portfolio and Webpage
This is the GitHub repository of my portfolio page, which documents my background, projects, and achievements among other things. This is done using Jekyll and GitHub Pages.

I used [Michael Rose's minimal mistakes theme](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) for my website.
